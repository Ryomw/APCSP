	<p class ="smart">Sophmore year has been a very interesting experience, one that I would describe as being neither 100 percent positive, nor completely negative. In terms of the "highs" of this year, within many of my classes I found a great ammount of interest in the new subjects covered, an example of this being through Modern World History. Prior to this year I had very little knowledge regarding historical revolutions, however, through this class, I was able to fully grasp their causes, the means by which they occurred, and the historical context of some of the most crucial revolutions throughout history. As for the "lows" of sophmore year, over the past few months I found myself lacking nearly any freetime on account of schoolwork and extra-curriculars. Furthermore, I also felt unmotivated quite often, which was somewhat discouraging, as, without said burnout I could have possibly worked harder to perform better in some classes. Anyways! Here are some images depicting the courses I partook in this year!</p>
