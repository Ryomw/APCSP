	<p class="white"> During the 2022-2023 school year, I took 7 classes: MWH, English, Spanish, Honors Chemistry, APCSP, Law and Society, Math, and Health Science. On top of these courses, I also participated in a number of demanding extra-curriculars, some of which were completely new to me. They included soccer, mock-trial, choir, and track. Alongside these activities, I also pursued my interests of making art, baking, singing, cooking, skiing, and spending time with family and friends. </p>
